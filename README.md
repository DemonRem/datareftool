# Data Ref Tool for X-Plane plugin development

**[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/leecbaker/datareftool/releases)**

[![Compile status](https://github.com/leecbaker/datareftool/workflows/Compile/badge.svg)](https://github.com/leecbaker/datareftool/actions)

DRT is an X-plane plugin intended to replacement for Sandy Barbour's Data Ref Editor (DRE). While the core functionality is much the same, many features are improved to make the experience nicer:

* Case insensitive search option
* Regex search option
* Only show datarefs that have changed recently
* Easier to deselect the search field
* Better display of array data

DRT is a work in progress; code contributions are welcome.

## Feature list

* Read, write, and search for datarefs
* Search for and execute commands
* Case insensitive search
* Regex search
* Supports Windows/Linux/Mac on X-Plane 10 and 11
* Filter only recently changed datarefs, and color datarefs that recently changed
* Displays all data types
* Display multiple elements of an array at once
* Make it easy to deselect the search field (unlike DRE). Use enter, return, escape, or tab, or click elsewhere in the DRT window.
* Cut/copy/paste/select all in search field and for datarefs (uses standard keyboard shortcuts)
* Multiple DRT windows viewable at once

## How to install

To install the plugin, download the latest release [on this page](https://github.com/leecbaker/datareftool/releases). Unzip the files, and copy the `DataRefTool_XP11_2020_12_06` to your plugins directory `X-Plane 11/Resources/plugins/`. Make sure to choose the XP11 version for X-Plane 11, or XP10 for X-Plane 10.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### FAQ: What are the keyboard shortcuts?

Glad you asked!

* Ctrl-X / &#8984;-X : cut
* Ctrl-C / &#8984;-C : copy
* Ctrl-V / &#8984;-V : paste

### FAQ: DRT can't find my dataref

DRT scans files to find datarefs. This might not work if your dataref is in an encrypted Lua file or something, so you have several options:

* If this is an aircraft, add a file called "dataref.txt" inside your aircraft directory with a list of datarefs and commands, one on each line
* Have your plugin send DRT a message with as described above in "Adding custom datarefs"
* Turn on "Impersonate DataRefEditor" on the plugin menu inside X-Plane. Before you do this, ensure that the DataRefEditor plugin is not installed. This way, X-Plane itself will tell DRT about all datarefs it knows about.

### FAQ: Using DRT causes X-Plane to crash

DRT reads every dataref published by every aircraft and plugin, on every frame of the simulation. Sometimes, they haven't fully been debugged, and may crash. (If you're a developer, the best way to do this is to run X-Plane in a debugger and look at the backtrace of the crash- if you see RefRecords::update() in the backtrace, this is likely what happened.)

If you can figure out which dataref caused the crash, the best way to work around this is to add the name of the dataref to a file called "drt_ignore.txt" in the Resources/plugins directory. This will cause DRT to never read the value of the dataref, even if it does come up in search results.

## Development details

### Compiling DataRefTool

The steps for how to build DRT can be seen in the [Github Actions file](.github/workflows/build.yml). You'll need to follow several steps to install all the necessary dependencies using Homebrew (Mac), vcpkg (Windows) or apt-get (Linux).

### Adding custom datarefs

You can use DRT to display your plugin's custom datarefs. Just send a message of type 0x01000000 with a pointer to the name of the dataref as the payload. There is an example of how to do this in [plugin_custom_dataref.cpp](src/plugin_custom_dataref.cpp). (This is exactly the same method that you use to add a custom dataref to Data Ref Editor.)
